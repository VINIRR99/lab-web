# LAB | WEB

This lab was made for the [Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/) online course at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

This code uses TypesScript, Class Composition and Class Inheritance to create a simple framework similar to Backbone.js and Marionette.js. It shows a collection of users, and a form to create a new user and save in a local JSON server.
